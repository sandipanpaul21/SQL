# In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. 

# You can check for NULL values using the expression IS NULL. 

# For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NULL;

# As you can see, IS NULL is useful when combined with WHERE to figure out what data you're missing.

# Sometimes, you'll want to filter out missing values so you only get results which are not NULL. 

# To do this, you can use the IS NOT NULL operator.

# For example, this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table.

SELECT name FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;

# Get the names of people who are still alive, i.e. whose death date is missing.

SELECT name FROM people
WHERE deathdate IS NULL;

# Get the title of every film which doesn't have a budget associated with it.

SELECT title FROM films
WHERE budget IS NULL;

# Get the number of films which don't have a language associated with them.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM films
WHERE language IS NULL;
