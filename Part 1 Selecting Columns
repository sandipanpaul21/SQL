# In SQL, you can select data from a table using a SELECT statement. 


# Selecting single column from a dataset

SELECT name FROM people;    #  List of all the names from people dataset

# In this query, SELECT and FROM are called keywords. In SQL, keywords are not case-sensitive.

SELECT title FROM films;    #  List of all the titles from films dataset

SELECT release_year FROM films;     #  List of all the release years from films dataset

SELECT name FROM people;    #  List of all the names from people dataset

SELECT 'DataCamp <3 SQL' AS result;     # DataCamp <3 SQL

SELECT 'SQL is cool!' AS result;    # SQL is cool!



# Selecting multiple columns

# To select multiple columns from a table, simply separate the column names with commas!

# For example, this query selects two columns, name and birthdate, from the people table:

SELECT name, birthdate FROM people;

# Sometimes,  you may want to select all columns from a table. Typing out every column name would be a pain, so there's a handy shortcut:

SELECT * FROM people;

# If you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the LIMIT keyword to limit the number of rows returned:

SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 10;


# SELECT DISTINCT 

# Often your results will include many duplicate values. 

# If you want to select all the unique values from a column, you can use the DISTINCT keyword. 

# This might be useful if, for example, you're interested in knowing which languages are represented in the films table:

SELECT DISTINCT language FROM films;

SELECT DISTINCT country FROM films;

SELECT DISTINCT certification FROM films;

SELECT DISTINCT role FROM roles;


# SELECT Count - Count the number of rows in a table

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews;

# If you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can call COUNT on just that column.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people;    # 8397

# Count the number of (non-missing) birth dates in the people table.

SELECT COUNT(birthdate) FROM people;    # 6152

# Count the number of unique birth dates in the people table.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate) FROM people;   # 5398
