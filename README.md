# SQL for Data Science

In this, it will cover all the aspects of SQL which are used in the field of Data Science.

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.

You can think of a relational database as a collection of tables. 

A table is just a set of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, which represents exactly one type of entity. 

For example, a table might represent employees in a company or purchases made, but not both.

Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a single entity. 

For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. 

Each column, or field, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. 

For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees.
